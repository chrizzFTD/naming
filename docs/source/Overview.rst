Overview

.. topic:: Name Objects

    This package offers classes representing names as strings that follow a certain pattern convention.
    New Name objects can subclass from the provided classes in a simple manner. Each Name object has a config attribute
    that contains the fields and patterns of the convention to follow. Names can also drop fields from their parent
    classes with the drops attribute, or they can merge / split fields with the compounds attribute.
